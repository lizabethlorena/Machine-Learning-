    "In this class, we have learned that there is a differecne between classification models and regression models. For a regression we are seeing how well x variables explain the y variable. These models entails linear, ridge, lasso, random forest, bagged trees, decision tree, SVM, and KNN Although these models can be used to regression analysis, some can also be used for classicication models and prediction. These models include KNN, logistic regression, penalized logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, bagged trees, and random forest. When using these models we take into consideration not only what they are meant to be used for but also if scaling is required, whether or whether not continous exponents or varibales only, wheather or whather not tuning paramters is necessary, if it can hold a large file size,and how fast or slow the prediction process takes to run.

    "In the field that we all strive to be in, predicition analysis is key. We are able to execute this process by using various models within coding platforms such as python. In order to begin this predicition process, we must not only be able to have the data available but to separate the date into traianing and testing data. We do this process by using the typical skeleton of the code, and by doing this alot of the data is typically used forr training rather than testing sets. This is important because by separating these sets we decrease the effects of bias/deviation. Within this process, we are essentially using the trianing data to create a model to not only make predictions but to aceept or decline these predicitions agaianst the testing data. "

    "K-Fold cross validation is a strategy used for classification and prediction. It is when we have a data set, particularly on the smaller end, and we split this data set into K folds. K representing any number to your liking that you want to split the data at hand, defualt is usually 5. However many folds you impliment is used separetly as a testing set at some given point in your analysis. In other words, we use this strategy as a resampling procedure in order to analyze model success. "

    "The main difference between k-fold cross vlaidation and stratified k-fold cross validation is how randomized you want to split your data, as well as keeping in mind what you do or don't want to take into account for your model. K-fold cross validation splits the dataset that you have in any number of folds you desire, where stratified k-fold validation takes into account the weight/ amount of observation within each fold and makes sure that they are equal. Straified k-fold is very much so a version of regualr k-fold, it just depends on the type of data you have and how you want to execute your analysis. Taking these facotrs into consideration, best route is to test out both and see which straetgy works best for your model. "

My reasoning behind adding these 3 new variables go as follows: # could represent something subjective so it can lead to someone opening up a spam mail, having the word \"meeting\" can easily draw working class into opening a spam mail, and of course the word \"money\" will draw anyones eyes into opening something that they shouldn't.
